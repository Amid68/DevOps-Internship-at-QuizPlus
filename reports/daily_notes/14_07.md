### Linux Namespaces

- `getpcaps` command can be used to check the capabilities of a process. 

#### Set UID
`setuid` is a special file permission that allows a user to run an executable with the permissions of the executable's owner. When a file has the setuid bit set, it means that when the file is executed, it will run with the permissions of the user who owns the file, rather than the user who is executing it. This temporarily elevates the privileges of the user running that sepcifc executable.

- In `ls -l` output, the setuid bit is represented by an "s" in the user execute position (e.g., `rwsr-xr-x`).
- To set the setuid bit on a file, you can use the `chmod` command:
  ```bash
  chmod u+s filename
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  chmod 4755 filename
  ```
- To remove the setuid bit, you can use:
  ```bash
  chmod u-s filename
  ```
- to search for all setuid files in the system:
    ```bash
    find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
    ```
