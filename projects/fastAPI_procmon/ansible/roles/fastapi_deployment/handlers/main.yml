# roles/fastapi_deployment/handlers/main.yml
# Handlers are triggered by notify statements and run only once
# even if notified multiple times - perfect for service reloads

- name: reload nginx
  systemd:
    name: nginx
    state: reloaded
  # Using systemd module instead of service for better control
  # This ensures nginx gracefully reloads without dropping connections
