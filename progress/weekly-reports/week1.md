# Week 1 Report - July 6-10, 2025

## Overview
Focused on foundational DevOps technologies and hands-on infrastructure projects. Created GitHub learning repository to track internship progress and completed terraform environments assignment. Also wrote my first systemd service.

## Projects Completed
**GitHub Learning Repository:** Set up a personal GitHub repository to document and track learning progress throughout the internship. Used GitHub CLI for repository management and automation.

**Terraform Environments Assignment:** Built multi-environment infrastructure using modules with dev/prod configurations. Implemented reusable modules with the local provider and learned terraform outputs for inter-module communication. Learned about state drift detection, and dependency graphs to understand resource relationships.

**SystemD Service Creation:** Wrote basic systemd service unit file with startup configuration, dependencies, and restart policies. Learned systemd basics including service management and unit file structure.

## Key Learning Achievements
**DNS:** Studied DNS hierarchy, record types (A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, TXT), troubleshooting with dig and nslookup commands, delegation, and glue records. Learned about local DNS infrastructure and the difference between iterative and recursive DNS resolution.

**Git:** Revised fundamentals including branching strategies, rebasing, reversing changes, cherry-pick operations, and tagging. Completed all levels on [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). Mastered merge strategies (fast-forward, squash, three-way, octopus) and conflict resolution best practices.

**Linux:** Deep dive into namespaces (PID, network, user, mount) and cgroups for resource management and isolation. Covered systemd service management basics. These concepts form the foundation for Docker/Kubernetes operations.

**Terraform:** Covered basics (HCL syntax, resources, variables, providers) to advanced concepts (modules, state management, workspaces). Learned about the local provider for file management, state drift detection, dependency graphs, and industry best practices.

**SRE:** Introduction to Site Reliability Engineering fundamentals, core methods, and best practices for maintaining reliable systems at scale.

**Project Workflow:** Learned the workflow of how tickets are created, assigned, and tracked in Jira.

## Skills Developed
Infrastructure as Code implementation, DNS configuration and troubleshooting, Linux system administration, version control workflows, SRE principles, and technical documentation creation.
